# Testnet Community Challenge

To celebrate the beta release of our decentralized AI training testnet, we are launching a community challenge. Participants will compete to train a sample model and verify results on-chain using testnet tokens.

## How to Participate
1. Follow the [TESTNET_TUTORIAL.md](TESTNET_TUTORIAL.md) to set up a node and job manager.
2. Request testnet tokens from the faucet by opening an issue in the repository with your address.
3. Post a training job using the `jobmanager` CLI. The provided dataset and model definition can be found in the `devnet` examples.
4. Claim a job as a worker and run the training task. Once completed, submit the results to earn the posted reward.
5. Scores will be tracked based on successfully completed jobs and model accuracy. Top participants will receive special recognition in our launch announcement.

## Timeline
- **Start:** July 1, 2026
- **End:** July 31, 2026

During this period we encourage feedback on the network. Bugs can be reported through GitHub issues. All tokens used in the challenge are for testing only and have no real-world value.

Have fun and help us battle-test the network!
