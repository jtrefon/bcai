- [ ] **Network Integration Testing**: Test cross-chain governance sync
- [ ] **Token Economics Validation**: Verify economic incentives work correctly

### **2. Documentation & API Standardization**
**Status: ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Documentation Gaps:**
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Complete governance API specification
- [ ] **Integration Guides**: Step-by-step integration tutorials
- [ ] **Security Best Practices**: Governance security guidelines
- [ ] **Economic Model Documentation**: Tokenomics and incentive structures
- [ ] **Deployment Procedures**: Production deployment checklist

### **3. Advanced Feature Implementation**
**Status: ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY - Foundation Complete**

**Enhancement Features:**
- [ ] **Automated Reputation Scoring**: Real-time reputation calculation
- [ ] **Advanced Delegation Chains**: Multi-level delegation resolution
- [ ] **Cross-Chain Proposal Sync**: Multi-blockchain governance coordination
- [ ] **Governance Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time governance metrics
- [ ] **Token Staking Integration**: Lock tokens for voting power
- [ ] **Proposal Templates**: Standardized proposal formats
