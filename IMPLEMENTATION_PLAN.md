# Implementation Planning

This document breaks down roadmap milestones into actionable tasks for development, updated based on comprehensive code review to reflect realistic current state and address critical gaps.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Previous milestones marked as "completed" represent prototype/demo implementations that require significant enhancement to meet production standards. This plan addresses the gap between ambitious documentation and current implementation reality.

## Missing Findings From Original Review

### Documentation vs Reality Gap
- [ ] **Add clear disclaimers about prototype status**

  - Add realistic capability statements to README
  - Create honest feature comparison chart
- [ ] **Align component documentation with actual capabilities**

### Specific Code Issues Not Yet Addressed
- [ ] **Fix inconsistent naming and style**
  - Some files use snake_case, others camelCase inconsistently
  - Missing consistent error message formatting
  - Inconsistent documentation style across modules
- [ ] **Address incomplete error handling**
  ```rust
  // Example from gpu.rs - should handle more GPU-specific errors
  pub enum GpuError {
      #[error("failed to request adapter: {0}")]
      RequestAdapter(String),
      #[error("failed to create device: {0}")]
      RequestDevice(String),
  }
  ```
  - Add specific error types for different failure modes
  - Implement proper error recovery strategies
  - Add user-friendly error messages

### Positive Findings That Should Be Preserved
- [ ] **Maintain excellent documentation structure**
  - Keep comprehensive whitepaper and architectural vision
  - Preserve modular crate structure
