# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. We welcome bug reports, feature requests and improvements from the community.

## Submitting Issues
- Use GitHub issues to report bugs or request features.
- For design ideas or comments on the protocol, participate in the open RFC discussions or open an issue referencing the RFC.

## RFC Feedback
The repository maintains an RFC process for major technical proposals. Feedback can be provided in the GitHub discussion for the RFC or by opening a pull request modifying the text. Public virtual meetings may also be held and summarized for transparency.

## Pull Requests
- Fork the repository and create a feature branch for your changes.
- Ensure your work aligns with the project's governance principles and sign your commits if required.
- When ready, open a pull request so maintainers and the community can review your contribution.

## Governance Approach
The project uses a DAO-based governance model where token holders and contributors can vote on proposals. The whitepaper describes this hybrid approach:

> Decentralization isn’t just in compute; it extends to decision-making. The project will implement a governance model that empowers the community of token holders and contributors to steer the network’s evolution... We adopt a Request for Comments (RFC) approach for technical proposals. Major changes go through an open RFC -> implementation -> on-chain vote pipeline.

Community participation is encouraged through reputation and open discussion so that power does not concentrate in a few hands.

## Communication Channels
Guiding principles recommend keeping governance discussions open through forums, Discord and regular community calls. The RFC invites everyone to:

> Follow our lead coordinator J. Trefon on Twitter (@jtrefon) for updates, join our Discord/Telegram to chat in real-time, and check out the "Good First Issues" on GitHub for newcomer tasks.

These channels provide ways to stay updated and collaborate with other contributors.
