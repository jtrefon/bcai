## üîç Understanding What Happened

### **1. Job Submission**
When you submit a job, BCAI:
- Validates your code for security issues
- Estimates resource requirements
- Broadcasts to worker nodes with matching capabilities
- Escrows your reward tokens until completion

### **2. Distributed Execution**
Your job runs on the BCAI network:
- **Worker nodes** compete to execute your training
- **Evaluator nodes** verify the results are correct
- **Consensus** ensures honest computation via Proof of Useful Work

### **3. Result Verification**
BCAI ensures quality:
- Multiple evaluators check the trained model
- Accuracy metrics are verified against test data
- Only valid results are accepted and rewarded

## üí∞ Understanding Token Economics

### **How Rewards Work**
```python
job_reward = 500  # BCAI tokens you offer
# Network distribution:
# - 85% to workers (425 tokens)
# - 10% to evaluators (50 tokens) 
# - 5% to network fee (25 tokens)
```

### **Cost Estimation**
```python
# Typical costs for MNIST CNN training:
estimated_cost = {
    "compute_cost": 200,      # Based on GPU-hours
    "network_fee": 25,        # 5% network fee
    "evaluator_fee": 50,      # Verification cost
    "total": 275              # Total cost in BCAI tokens
}

# Your 500 token offer should cover this comfortably
```

### **Getting BCAI Tokens**
```bash
# For testnet (free tokens)
bcai-cli faucet --address YOUR_ADDRESS

# For mainnet (purchase)
bcai-cli buy-tokens --amount 1000 --usd
```

## üéõÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

### **Custom Model Architectures**
```python
# ResNet example
training_code = '''
import torchvision.models as models

model = models.resnet18(pretrained=False, num_classes=10)
# Your training code here...
'''

job = TrainingJob(
    name="resnet18-mnist",
    code=training_code,
    resources={"gpu_memory_gb": 8},  # ResNet needs more memory
    reward_tokens=1000
)
```

### **Using Real Datasets**
```python
job = TrainingJob(
    name="real-mnist-training",
    code=training_code,
    data_source="ipfs://QmYourDatasetHash",  # IPFS dataset
    data_config={
        "format": "pytorch",
        "train_split": 0.8,
        "validation_split": 0.2
    },
    reward_tokens=800
)
```

### **Resource Optimization**
```python
# For faster training
job = TrainingJob(
    resources={
        "gpu_memory_gb": 16,    # More GPU memory
        "cpu_cores": 8,         # More CPU cores
        "memory_gb": 32,        # More RAM
        "priority": "high"      # Higher priority (costs more)
    },
    reward_tokens=1500  # Higher reward for premium resources
)
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### **Error: Insufficient Balance**
```bash
Error: Insufficient BCAI token balance (50 available, 500 required)
```
**Solution:**
```bash
# Get testnet tokens
bcai-cli faucet --amount 1000

# Or reduce your reward
job.reward_tokens = 50
```

### **Error: Code Validation Failed**
```bash
Error: Import 'requests' not allowed in sandboxed environment
```
**Solution:**
```python
# Only use allowed ML libraries
requirements=["torch", "torchvision", "numpy", "scikit-learn"]
# Remove: requests, urllib, os, sys, subprocess
```

### **Error: Job Timeout**
```bash
Error: Job exceeded maximum runtime (10 minutes)
```
**Solution:**
```python
resources={
    "max_runtime_minutes": 30,  # Increase timeout
    "priority": "high"          # Or use higher priority
}
```

### **Error: No Available Workers**
```bash
Error: No workers available with required capabilities
```
**Solution:**
```python
resources={
    "gpu_memory_gb": 2,   # Reduce requirements
    "cpu_cores": 1,       # More workers available
    "memory_gb": 4        # Lower specs = more workers
}
```

## üîç Monitoring Your Job

### **Real-time Status**
```python
# Monitor job progress
status = client.get_job_status(result.job_id)
print(f"Status: {status.phase}")
print(f"Progress: {status.progress}%")
print(f"Current worker: {status.assigned_worker}")

# Stream training logs
for log_entry in client.stream_logs(result.job_id):
    print(f"[{log_entry.timestamp}] {log_entry.message}")
```

### **Performance Metrics**
```python
# Get detailed metrics
metrics = client.get_job_metrics(result.job_id)
print(f"GPU utilization: {metrics.gpu_utilization}%")
print(f"Memory usage: {metrics.memory_usage_gb}GB")
print(f"Training speed: {metrics.samples_per_second} samples/sec")
```
