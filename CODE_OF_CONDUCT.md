# Code of Conduct

We strive to foster an open and welcoming community. Participants are expected to act professionally and respectfully toward others.

## Expected Behavior
- Be considerate and inclusive of differing viewpoints.
- Use respectful language in all discussions.
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully.
- Help create a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassing, discriminatory or derogatory comments.
- Trolling or personal attacks.
- Publishing others' private information without permission.

## Reporting Issues
If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior, please email **team@bcai.org** or open a confidential issue. Reports will be reviewed by the maintainers who will determine appropriate action.

## Moderation Process
Maintainers may remove comments, reject contributions or temporarily ban accounts that violate this Code of Conduct. Repeated or severe violations may result in permanent exclusion from community spaces. Appeals can be directed to the project's governance DAO for final review.
