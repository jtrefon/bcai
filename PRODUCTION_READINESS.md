- [x] Multi-GPU support (CUDA, Metal, WGPU)
- [x] Python bridge for PyTorch/TensorFlow integration
- [x] Distributed storage and P2P networking

### ðŸ”§ **Critical Issues to Address**

#### **1. Build Stability (Priority: HIGH)**
```bash
# Current Issues:
- Multiple rand versions (0.7.3, 0.8.5) 
- Potential candle-core conflicts

# Actions:
â–¡ Update Cargo.toml to use consistent dependency versions
â–¡ Run cargo tree --duplicates to identify conflicts
â–¡ Test build on fresh environment
â–¡ Set up reproducible builds with Cargo.lock
```

#### **2. Enhanced Testing Coverage**
```bash
# Current: 62 tests passing
# Target: 100+ tests with stress testing

â–¡ Add load testing for 1000+ concurrent PoUW tasks
â–¡ Network partition tolerance tests
â–¡ Byzantine fault tolerance validation
â–¡ Memory leak detection under sustained load
```

#### **3. Performance Benchmarking**
```rust
// Current Performance Targets Met:
// âœ… 3-4x faster than traditional VMs
// âœ… 50x faster tensor operations  
// âœ… Support for 1000+ concurrent jobs

// Next Targets (90 days):
// â–¡ 10x faster than traditional VMs
// â–¡ 100x faster tensor operations
// â–¡ Support for 10,000+ concurrent jobs
```

### ðŸŽ¯ **Immediate Action Items (This Week)**

#### **Day 1-2: Build System Fix**
```bash
# 1. Dependency Resolution
cargo update
cargo tree --duplicates > dependency_analysis.txt
# Review and fix conflicts in Cargo.toml

# 2. Test Enhanced Genesis
cargo test genesis_and_transfer_with_pouw -- --nocapture
# Verify progressive PoUW complexity works

# 3. Performance Baseline
cargo test test_real_pouw_computation -- --nocapture
