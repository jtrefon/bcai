# Stub Removal Progress

This file tracks the ongoing effort to replace prototype stubs with real implementations.

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Model hash in training results | âœ… Replaced with real PoUW output |
| Integration test key generation | âœ… Uses keygen when available |
| Trainer metrics | âœ… Records training duration |
| Evaluator verification | âœ… Uses PoUW verifier |
| Miner PoUW solution | âœ… Solves tasks during block creation |
| Job manager submit logic | âœ… Escrows reward and records submission |
| P2P event handling | âœ… Processes Kademlia peers and ping/pong |
| Chunk data handler | âœ… Stores chunks and tracks progress |
| Chunk request handler | âœ… Serves requested chunks from cache |
| Chunk response dispatch | âœ… Routes responses to awaiting tasks |
| Transfer wait logic | âœ… Waits for chunk replies with timeout |
| Transfer coordinator | âœ… Sequentially requests missing chunks |
| Compression utilities | âœ… Basic LZ4 compression implemented |
| Encryption utilities | âœ… AES-GCM chunk encryption available |
| Chunk cache | âœ… Functional in-memory LRU cache |
| Zstd compression | âœ… Added high-ratio algorithm support |
| Bandwidth checks | âœ… Enforces per-peer limits |
| Replication auto-heal | âœ… Sends chunks to new nodes |
| Other listed placeholders | ðŸš§ Pending |
